## Hi there,  my name is Ksenia NuzhdenkovaðŸ‘‹ 
I completed the course "Data Analyst" from Yandex.Practicum. During my studies, I learned how to work with very large amounts of data, studied the main statistical methods of data analysis, and learned how to create informative graphs and diagrams.

Technology stack: Pyton (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), SQL (PosgreSQL), BI tools (Tableau, Power BI).
